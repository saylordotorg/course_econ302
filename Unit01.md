foundation for an understanding of the most important aspects of money
and banking by introducing you to financial markets, the banking system,
and other financial systems, as well as providing you with a
comprehensive discussion of money and its various functions.  *

**1.1 Why Study Financial Markets?** <span id="1.1"></span> 
*Note: The concept of financial Markets is critical to understanding how
the financial system channels funds from savers to investor and its role
in economic growth.  With the understanding of financial markets, you
will make sense of the financial activities that are so widely reported
in the media.  For example, why do different financial markets exist?
 How do they operate?  How are they interrelated?  The bond market is
also known as the debt, credit, or fixed income market.  The bond market
is sensitive to interest rates, because interest rates are the price
paid for bonds.  The stock market is one of the most important sources
for companies to raise money.  The foreign exchange market allows
businesses to convert one currency to another currency.  The importance
of foreign exchange markets has grown with increased global economic
activity, trade, and investment, as well as with technology that makes
real-time exchange of information and trading possible.*

**Note: The financial system is the system that allows the transfer of
money between savers and borrowers.  It comprises financial
institutions, markets, instruments, services, practices, and
transactions.  A financial institution is an institution that provides
financial services for its clients or members, for example banks,
insurance companies, and investment firms.  The health of the economy is
closely related to the soundness of its banking system.  The borrowing,
lending, and related activities of banks facilitate the process of
production, distribution, exchange, and consumption of wealth.
 Financial innovation refers to the creating and marketing of new types
of securities.**

*Note: The business cycle refers to economy-wide fluctuations in
production or economic activities over several months or years.  Money
is one of the factors that cause business cycles.  Monetary inflation is
a rise in the general level of prices of goods and services, which is
caused by a sustained increase in the money supply of a country.
 Generally speaking, a higher real interest rate reduces the broad money
supply.  Fiscal policy is the use of government expenditure and revenue
collection to influence the economy.  Monetary policy is the use of the
supply of money by the monetary authority of a country to affect the
economy.*

**1.4 Overview of the Financial System** <span id="1.4"></span> 
*Note: The financial system is a critical element in a well-functioning
economy. Financial markets (bond and stock markets) and financial
intermediaries (banks, insurance companies, and pension funds) move
funds from lender-savers to borrower-spenders.  The diversity of both
lenders and borrowers is responsible for the enormous array of different
financial instruments.  Financial markets move these funds directly from
lender-savers to borrower-spenders, while financial intermediaries
accomplish this function indirectly. *

**1.5 What Is Money?** <span id="1.5"></span> 
*Note: Money has always been important to the economy, because it
promotes economic efficiency.  In this subunit, we develop a current
definition of money by addressing the functions of money and by learning
about the different forms of money through history.  We have come to
understand money as a social invention that serves to facilitate trade,
and because of that, money has an important role to play in allowing and
promoting economic growth.  In this subunit, we deal with a problem that
has received increased attention among economists since the mid-1970s:
just what is money or the money supply?  This topic allows us to
consider the importance of money, discovering why it evolves in all but
the most primitive societies.*
