**Unit 2: Financial Markets** <span id="2"></span> 
*The loanable funds market is the broad marketplace that coordinates the
borrowing and lending decisions of different business firms and
households.  It consists of commercial banks, savings and loans, stocks
and bonds, and insurance companies.  Loanable funds are supplied as
households and firms save money rather than spend it on their own
consumption.  The amount of funds supplied at any given time is a
function of the fund price, or interest rate.  However, in financial
markets, there are two types of interest rates: “nominal interest
rates,” which overstate the real cost of borrowing during an
inflationary period, and real interest rates, which are adjusted for
inflation (or changes in prices).  Real interest rates indicate the real
cost to the borrower (and the yield to the lender) in terms of goods and
services.  This unit will focus on the capital market, which consists of
various marketplaces in which investments (such as stocks and bonds) are
bought and sold. *

**2.1 Understanding Interest Rates** <span id="2.1"></span> 
*Note: Interest rates are among the most important variables in the
economy.  This subunit explains how interest rates are measured and
shows that the interest rate on a bond is not always an accurate measure
of how good of an investment it will be.  The most accurate measure of
interest rates is yield to maturity.  The concept of yield to maturity
reveals that bond prices and interest rates are negatively related, and
the longer the maturity of the bond, the greater the change in the price
of the bond from a given change in the interest rate will be.  Interest
rates are important, because they affect how much people and firms wish
to save or borrow.  The terms defined in this subunit will be employed
throughout the book.*

*Note: This subunit examines how interest rates are determined and the
factors that influence their behavior.  The supply and demand analysis
developed here explains why interest rates have had such substantial
fluctuations in recent years.  Interest rates fluctuate.  In this
subunit, we employ both the bond market and the liquidity preference
frameworks to see how a variety of shocks affect interest rates.  We
address how a change in the money supply affects the interest rate, both
in the near term while other determinants of the interest rate are held
constant, and in the long run when other determinants are allowed to
adjust to the change in the money supply.*

**2.3 The Risk and Term Structure of Interest Rates** <span
id="2.3"></span> 
*Note: The supply and demand analysis of interest rate behavior in the
previous section examined the determination of just one interest rate,
even though there are many different interest rates in the economy.
 This subunit completes the interest rate picture by examining the
relationship among interest rates on securities that differ in their
riskiness, liquidity, income tax treatment, and term to maturity.  There
are many different interest rates.  Due to differences in risk,
liquidity, and tax treatment, bonds with the same term to maturity may
have different interest rates.  The relationship between these interest
rates is known as the risk structure of interest rates.  Bonds with
different terms to maturity (but that are otherwise the same) also have
different interest rates.  The relationship between these interest rates
is known as the term structure of interest rates.*

**2.4 The Stock Market, the Theory of Rational Expectations, and the
Efficient Market Hypothesis** <span id="2.4"></span> 
*Note: This subunit discusses theories that explain changes in the stock
market.  First, fundamental theories of stock valuation are developed.
 Second, the theory of rational expectations is introduced, along with
the implications of this theory as applied to financial markets, where
it is known as the efficient market hypothesis.  Recently, expectations
theory has received great attention as economists have searched for more
adequate explanations of the observed behavior of economic variables,
such as unemployment, interest rates, and asset prices.  There are a
variety of fundamental theories that underlie the valuation of stocks
and other securities.  These theories require that we understand how
expectations affect stock market behavior, because to value a stock,
people must form expectations about a firm's future dividends and the
rate to discount future values.  The theory of rational expectations,
when applied to financial markets, implies the efficient market
hypothesis.  Although the evidence is mixed, the theory of rational
expectations is a good place to start analyzing expectations.*
