This course is designed to provide you with a thorough understanding of
the importance of money, banking, and financial markets of a developed
economy.  Money, financial institutions, and financial markets have
emerged as instruments of payments for the services of factors of
production, such as labor and capital.  The use of money facilitates
business in a market by acting as a common medium of exchange.  Of
course, as that market expands and develops on a national and
international level, the importance of money, banking, and other
financial markets expands to accommodate innumerable exchanges. This
course will allow you to examine not only the origins and nature of
money, but also the institutions and markets that have evolved to enable
the exchange of goods and services worldwide.  It will provide you with
the opportunity to examine the instruments and strategies assisting
production, distribution, and consumption.  Also, this course will help
you develop an appreciation for important concepts in economics, from
interest rates and central banking to stocks, bonds, and foreign
exchange.

### Course Information

Welcome to ECON302.  Below, please find general information on the
course and its requirements.  
  
 **Course Designer**: Samuel K. Andoh  
  
 **Primary Resources**: This course is composed of a range of different
free, online materials.  However, it makes primary use of the following
materials:

-   Lecture slides for Frederic Mishkin’s *The Economics of Money, Banking, and Financial
    Markets* (8e)
-   Optional: *[The Economics of Money, Banking, and Financial Markets](https://archive.org/details/MoneyBanking9e)* (9e)
-   *Money and Banking, v. 1.0* ([HTML](http://2012books.lardbucket.org/books/finance-banking-and-money-v1.0/) | [PDF](http://www.saylor.org/site/textbooks/Money%20and%20Banking.pdf))
-   Articles from various sources available on the internet

**Requirements for Completion**: In order to complete this course, you
should have completed principles of microeconomics (ECON101) and
principles of macroeconomics (ECON102).  These pre-requisites lay the
foundation for understanding the advanced material in ECON302.  
    
 You have to work through each unit of this course and all of its
assigned materials.  In order to pass this course, you have to complete
the final exam and earn a 70% or higher.  Your score on the exam will be
tabulated as soon as you finish it.  If you do not pass the exam, you
may take it again.  
  
 Note that you will only receive an official grade on your final exam.
 However, in order to adequately prepare for it, you will need to work
through the assignments and all the reading material in the course.  
    
 **Time Commitment**: This course should take you a total of
approximately **90 hours** to complete.  Each unit includes a time
advisory that lists the amount of time you are expected to spend on each
subunit.  These should help you plan your time accordingly.  It may be
useful to take a look at these time advisories and to determine how much
time you have over the next few weeks to complete each unit and set
goals for yourself.  
  
 **Tips/Suggestions**: It is important to pay close attention to the new
terminologies you encounter in this course and every other course.  You
may think you know what money, income or finance is, but as used by
economists, these words have technical meanings.  Spend the time to
study the new vocabulary and it will pay handsome dividends.   
  
 As you read, take careful notes on a separate sheet of paper.  Mark
down any important equations, formulas, and definitions that stand out
to you.  These notes will be useful to review as you study for your
final exam.
