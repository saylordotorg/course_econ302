**Unit 4: Central Banking** <span id="4"></span> 
*A central bank is commonly known as a lender of last resort, or as a
“bankers’ bank.”  Most developing countries have a central bank that
controls the credit system. These central banks exercise control by
setting short-term interest rates (that is, the rates at which loans of
last resort are made).  Central banks may also control the money supply
by requiring participating banks to keep a percentage of their holdings
in reserve.  Typically, central banks issue bank notes (in the United
States, the Treasury creates the currency), act as the government’s
bank, accept deposits, and make loans to commercial banks.  The United
States’ central bank, known as the Federal Reserve System, was
established in 1913 by an act of Congress; unlike most other central
banks, the Federal Reserve is privately owned by banks in each of its
twelve districts.  Far from being above reproach, however, some
economists (among them Milton Friedman, John Kenneth Galbraith, and Ben
Bernanke) have argued that the policies of the Federal Reserve were
largely responsible for bringing about the Great Depression of 1929.
 This unit will review the structure and origins of central banks, as
well as the various instruments at its disposal.  
  
 *The recession of 2009 has its roots in the malfunctions of the
financial institutions of several major economies.  The use of
derivatives and other financial products, the question of asymmetric
information, and the role of banks (especially central banks) make this
a timely topic.  Unfortunately, at the time of this course’s
development, there are few textbook descriptions of its causes, the
extent of its damage, or the proposals developed for its ultimate
resolution.  Nevertheless, this unit will prove critical to a thorough
understanding of the current controversies.  **

**4.1 Structure of the Central Banks and the Federal Reserve System**
<span id="4.1"></span> 
*Note: Until the creation of the European Central Bank, one could say
that the Federal Reserve System had the most unusual structure of any
central bank.  This subunit describes the unique structure of the
Federal Reserve System and its evolution since 1913.  Although the
Federal Reserve has been granted a high degree of independence, a
clearer understanding of its decisions requires that one acknowledge the
political and bureaucratic forces influencing its behavior.  This
section describes the institutional structure of the Federal Reserve,
the European Central Bank and other foreign central banks.  Knowing the
institutional structure of a central bank will help you to understand
who controls the central bank, what motivates its behavior, and who
holds the reigns of power within the central bank.  A key feature of the
institutional structure of a central bank is the degree to which it is
independent of political pressures from government officials outside of
the central bank.  This section examines the advantages and
disadvantages of central bank independence.*

**4.2 Multiple Deposit Creation and the Money Supply Process** <span
id="4.2"></span> 
*Note: This subunit describes the money supply process.  Bank deposits
are by far the largest component of the money supply.  The focus of this
section is on how banks create deposits and how deposit creation affects
the money supply.  Movements in the money supply influence us all by
affecting the health of the economy; thus, it is important to understand
how the money supply is determined.  Because deposits at banks (and
other depository institutions) comprise the largest component of the
money supply, understanding how these deposits are created is the first
step in understanding the money supply process.*

**4.3 Determination of the Money Supply** <span id="4.3"></span> 
*Note: The section developed a simple model of multiple deposit
creation. That model illustrated the process of multiple deposit
creation but was lacking in two respects. It assumed that depositors
hold no currency and banks hold no excess reserves. This section relaxes
those assumptions in order to derive a more realistic money multiplier.
After deriving a more realistic money multiplier, this section describes
the sources of movement in the monetary base, the money multiplier and
the money supply. Throughout this section, money (M) is defined as M1
which is currency plus checkable deposits. This section incorporates
depositor and bank behavior into the monetary process, presenting a more
realistic model of the money supply process. The analysis is separated
into three steps. First, because the Fed's control of the monetary base
is more precise than its control over reserves, the model links changes
in the money supply to changes in the monetary base. Next, the money
multiplier, a ratio that relates the change in the money supply to a
given change in the monetary base, is derived. Third, factors
determining the money multiplier are examined.*

**4.4 Tools of Monetary Policy** <span id="4.4"></span> 
*Note: This section examines how the Federal Reserve uses its three
policy tools—open market operations, changes in discount lending, and
changes in reserve requirements—to manipulate the money supply and
interest rates.  The Fed uses three tools to manipulate the money supply
and interest rates: open market operations, discount lending, and
reserve requirements.  This subunit looks at how the Fed uses these
tools to influence the market for reserves and the federal funds rate.
 The section ends with a discussion of the tools of monetary policy used
by other central banks besides the Federal Reserve.*

**4.5 Conduct of Monetary Policy: Goals and Targets** <span
id="4.5"></span> 
*Note: This subunit examines how central banks use the monetary policy
tools to achieve their policy goals and objectives.  The first part of
the section discusses the important goals that central banks attempt to
achieve through their conduct of monetary policy and regulatory duties.
 The general operating strategy employed by central banks to achieve
these goals is presented in the second part of the section.  The third
part ties together the first two parts by examining the Fed’s past
policy procedures.  This historical perspective provides important
insights when it comes to assessing current and future monetary policy
actions.  The subunit concludes with a brief discussion of the Taylor
rule as a guide for setting the federal funds rate.*
