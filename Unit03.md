**Unit 3: Financial Institutions** <span id="3"></span> 
*Among the many challenges in any exchange economy are transaction
costs, or the time, effort, and other resources necessary to search out,
negotiate, and conduct exchanges of goods and services.  Money and the
financial institutions that have evolved around money enable people to
gain from complex exchanges by providing a common denominator into which
all goods and services can be converted.  As economies grow and expand,
they give rise to a wide variety of institutions that function as the
fuel that propels the economic mechanism.  Over time, special
institutions with the primary function of guaranteeing that money and
other financial assets flow throughout the entire economy have
developed.  *  
  
 *This unit will study financial institutions and their effects on the
overall economy.  It will also introduce financial intermediaries and
the role they play in solving the problem of asymmetric information,
where one party has insufficient information about another party
involved in a transaction, which hinders accurate decision-making.*

**3.1 An Economic Analysis of Financial Structures** <span
id="3.1"></span> 
*Note: The financial structure is designed to promote economic
efficiency.  When events reduce the economic efficiency of financial
institutions, a financial crisis may occur, which has severe
consequences for the economy.  Lending is risky.  Borrowers with ill
intentions may choose to skip town and fail to leave a forwarding
address, and even those with honest intentions may undertake actions
that increase the probability that they will be unable to meet their
payment obligations.  Given these hazards, individuals may be
understandably reluctant to lend.  Although lending is risky for the
lender, the channeling of funds from individuals with savings to others
with productive investment opportunities is essential for economic
growth.  Channeling funds from savers to investors is beneficial to the
economy and the parties to the exchange, but only if investors have
incentives to honor their promises and pay back the borrowed funds.*

**3.2 Banking and the Management of Financial Institutions** <span

*Note: Banks are the most important financial intermediaries in the
United States. In this subunit, we examine the bank balance sheet and
the basic principles of bank management in order to improve our
understanding of how banks operate in our economy.  We focus on how
commercial banks are managed in order to maximize profits.  We
concentrate on commercial banks, because they are the most important
financial intermediaries.*

**3.3 Banking Industry: Structure and Competition** <span
id="3.3"></span> 
*Note: Banks are financial intermediaries in business to earn profits.
 Compared to other countries, the United States has many more small
banks.  In this subunit, we see why there are so many banks in the
United States, and we address the competitiveness, efficiency, and
soundness of the banking system.  This section begins with a brief
introduction to the history of banking in the U.S.  It then examines how
financial innovations have increased the competitive environment in
banking, fundamentally changing this industry.  The section then
describes the commercial banking industry and goes on to look at the
thrift industry in the United States.  Lastly, we examine the forces
behind the growth in international banking with special emphasis on
developments that have affected us in the United States.*

**3.4 Economic Analysis of Banking Regulation** <span id="3.4"></span> 
*Note: In this subunit, we use economic analysis to show why financial
institutions and banks are so heavily regulated.  Banking regulation,
however, is not always successful.  Banking crises cause regulators to
reform existing regulations.  This section develops an economic analysis
of how banking regulation affects the behavior of banking institutions.
 This analysis explains why banking is among the most heavily regulated
sectors of the economy, why the banking crisis occurred in the 1980s,
and whether recent banking legislation or other proposed reforms are
likely to ensure that future financial crises can be avoided.*

**3.5 Non-Bank Finance** <span id="3.5"></span> 
*Note: The distinction between bank and non-bank financial institutions,
such as insurance, pension funds, finance companies, and mutual funds,
is blurry.  This subunit addresses how non-bank financial institutions
operate, how they are regulated, and recent trends in non-bank finance.
 This section will introduce you to a wide array of non-bank financial
institutions.  Not long ago this group of institutions was more
appropriately studied in a course on financial institutions and of
little importance to students of money and banking.  Recent financial
innovation, however, has erased many of the barriers that once separated
banks and non-bank financial institutions, obscuring the distinction
between courses in financial institutions and money and banking.  For
this reason, a brief overview of the types and activities of these
institutions will provide you with a better understanding of the
functioning and structure of financial markets.*

**3.6 Financial Derivatives** <span id="3.6"></span> 
*Note: Due to the increase in interest rate volatility in the 1980s and
1990s, financial innovation has generated financial derivatives to
reduce risks faced by financial institutions.  Financial derivatives are
instruments that have payoffs that are linked to previously issued
securities, such as forward contracts, financial futures, options, and
swaps.  Beginning in the 1970s and continuing into the 1980s and 1990s,
interest rates and foreign exchange rates became more volatile,
increasing the risk to financial institutions.  To combat this, managers
of financial institutions have demanded financial instruments to better
manage risk.  These instruments, called financial derivatives, have
become an important source of profits for financial institutions,
particularly larger banks.  In this subunit, we investigate the use of
forward contracts, financial futures, options, and swaps to reduce
risk.*
