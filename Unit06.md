**Unit 6: Monetary Theory** <span id="6"></span> 
*Monetary theory is the study of the effect of money on the economy.
 Over time, various theories have evolved to explain the demand for
money.  These include the classical theories of Irving Fisher, Alfred
Marshall, and A. C. Pigou; the Keynesian theories of the mid-twentieth
century; and, finally, the modern quantity theory associated with Milton
Friedman.  The extent to which the demand for money is affected by
interest rates is one of the central questions in monetary theory;
accordingly, it will be addressed in this unit.  *

the ISLM model of simultaneous money and goods markets equilibrium.
 These models allow us to better understand the functioning of the
economy and to better assess the effects of fiscal and monetary policy
actions.  In addition, the ISLM model is used to derive the aggregate
demand curve that is used in aggregate demand and supply analysis.*

**6.3 Monetary and Fiscal Policy in the ISLM Model** <span
id="6.3"></span> 
*Note: In this section, we explore the mechanics of the ISLM model,
discovering how monetary policy—the control of the money supply and
interest rates—and fiscal policy—the control of government spending and
taxes—affect the level of aggregate output and interest rates.  Because
policymakers have these two tools at their disposal, they will be
interested in knowing the effects each policy can be expected to have on
the economy.  The ISLM model provides a convenient and powerful
framework for comparing the relative effects of proposed monetary and
fiscal actions.  By comparing these predicted effects, policymakers can
better decide which policy is most appropriate.*

output and the price level.  The model is very powerful in gaining
insight into the workings of the economy, yet it is relatively simple
and, with a little work, relatively easy to master.*

**6.7 Rational Expectations: Implications for Policy** <span
id="6.7"></span> 
*Note: This subunit discusses the implications of rational expectations
theory for macroeconomic stabilization policies.  Rational expectations
theory arose in the 1970s as an attempt to explain "stagflation" and the
failure of government policies to prevent this unhappy state.  How can
the apparent ineffectiveness of government stabilization policies be
explained?  This section introduces models that attempt to answer this
question.*
