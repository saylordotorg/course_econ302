**Unit 5: Foreign Exchange** <span id="5"></span> 
*Foreign exchange markets are marketplaces in which the currencies of
different countries are bought and sold.  Market transactions transfer
the currency of one country into that of another and thereby settle
accounts.  Within foreign exchange markets, currencies are bought either
“spot” or “forward.”  In a spot market, currencies are bought
immediately and exchange rates (for example, 1 dollar to 78 Euros) are
managed by the governments.  In forward markets, currencies are bought
and sold for future transactions.  Forward rates are largely determined
by the market’s expectations for currency appreciation or depreciation
at a future date.*

*Note: A nominal anchor is a variable used to establish a price level
(for example, the inflation rate, an exchange rate, or the money supply)
as a target for achieving a goal, such as price stability.  For example,
if a monetary authority sets a nominal anchor of 0.13 percent inflation,
it then uses its various tools and strategies to achieve that target.*
